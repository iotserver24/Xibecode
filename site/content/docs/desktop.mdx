## Prerequisites

The desktop app requires the `xibecode` CLI to be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g xibecode
xibecode config --set-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## How It Works

The desktop app is a thin Electron shell (~5MB) that runs the `xibecode` CLI underneath:

1. **Open the app** — You see a VS Code-style welcome screen
2. **Pick a folder** — Open Folder, Clone Repository, or New Project
3. **XibeCode starts** — The app runs `xibecode chat` in your chosen folder
4. **Full WebUI** — The entire XibeCode IDE loads in a native window

Since all the AI logic lives in the CLI package, **updating the CLI automatically updates the desktop app's capabilities** — no need to download a new app version.

```bash
# Update the CLI to get new features in the desktop app
npm update -g xibecode
```

## Features

### Welcome Screen

- **XibeCode branding** with gradient ASCII logo
- **Open Folder** — Native OS file picker
- **Clone Repository** — Git clone dialog
- **New Project** — Create and open a new folder
- **Recent Projects** — Quick access to previously opened folders with timestamps
- **CLI Status** — Shows installed xibecode version

### IDE Window

Once you open a folder, the full XibeCode WebUI loads with:

- AI Chat panel with streaming responses
- Monaco code editor with syntax highlighting
- File explorer with recursive directory tree
- Git panel with staging, commits, and diffs
- Integrated terminal with PTY support
- Environment variables editor
- Chat history with per-project persistence
- 13 agent modes including interactive Plan Mode

## Installation

### Windows

Download the `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/iotserver24/xibecode/releases) and run it.

### macOS

Download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag XibeCode to your Applications folder.

<Callout type="warn" title="macOS Unsigned App">
Since the app is not signed, you may need to right-click and select "Open" the first time, then click "Open" in the dialog.
</Callout>

### Linux

**Debian/Ubuntu (.deb):**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i xibecode-desktop_0.5.0_amd64.deb
```

**Fedora/RHEL (.rpm):**
```bash
sudo rpm -i xibecode-desktop-0.5.0.x86_64.rpm
```

**AppImage (any distro):**
```bash
chmod +x XibeCode-0.5.0-x86_64.AppImage
./XibeCode-0.5.0-x86_64.AppImage
```

## Troubleshooting

### "xibecode not found"

The desktop app requires the CLI to be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g xibecode
```

### Blank screen after opening folder

Make sure the CLI is up to date and the WebUI is built:

```bash
npm update -g xibecode
```

### App doesn't open on macOS

Right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper for unsigned apps.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotserver24/xibecode
cd xibecode/electron
npm install
npm run build:ts
npm run dev
```
