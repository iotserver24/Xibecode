Get productive with XibeCode in minutes. This guide walks you through your first autonomous coding session and introduces you to the key features.

## Your First Task

The `run` command lets XibeCode autonomously complete coding tasks. Just describe what you want:

```bash
xibecode run "Create a Python script that prints hello world"
```

XibeCode will read your project, create the file, and verify it works — all autonomously.

## Interactive Chat

For iterative development and quick questions, use chat mode:

```bash
xibecode chat
```

In chat mode you can:
- Ask questions about your codebase
- Request code changes step by step
- Switch between agent personas with `/mode`
- Toggle tool execution with `tools on/off`
- Type `exit` or `quit` to leave

## Agent Modes (Personas)

XibeCode features 13 specialized agent personas, each optimized for different tasks. Switch modes to get specialized assistance:

```bash
# In chat mode, switch personas
/mode plan      # Aria the Architect - planning and analysis
/mode agent     # Default mode - full coding capabilities
/mode debugger  # Dex the Detective - bug hunting and fixing
/mode tester    # Tess the QA Engineer - testing and quality
/mode security  # Sentinel the Guardian - security audits
/mode review    # Nova the Critic - code reviews
```

### Key Personas

| Mode | Persona | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| `agent` | Default Agent | Full-stack development, building features |
| `plan` | Aria the Architect | Understanding codebases, planning implementations |
| `debugger` | Dex the Detective | Finding and fixing bugs |
| `tester` | Tess the QA Engineer | Writing tests, ensuring quality |
| `security` | Sentinel the Guardian | Security audits, vulnerability detection |

## Run Command Options

```bash
xibecode run [prompt] [options]

Options:
  -f, --file <path>           Read prompt from a file
  -m, --model <model>         AI model to use (default: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
  -b, --base-url <url>        Custom API base URL
  -k, --api-key <key>         API key (overrides config)
  -d, --max-iterations <num>  Maximum iterations (default: 50)
  -v, --verbose               Show detailed logs
  --dry-run                   Preview changes without making them
  --changed-only              Focus only on git-changed files
  --mode <mode>               Start in a specific agent mode
```

## Example Tasks

### Build a Feature

```bash
xibecode run "Add user authentication to the Express API:
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- JWT token generation
- Middleware to protect routes"
```

### Fix a Bug

```bash
xibecode run "The tests in test/user.test.js are failing.
Debug and fix the issues." --verbose
```

### Refactor Code

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor src/ to use TypeScript:
- Convert all .js files to .ts
- Add type annotations
- Create types.ts for shared types"
```

### Generate Tests

```bash
xibecode run "Write comprehensive tests for userController.js:
- Test all endpoints
- Test error cases
- Use Jest
- Achieve >80% coverage"
```

### Preview Changes (Dry Run)

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor authentication module" --dry-run
```

### Focus on Changed Files

```bash
xibecode run "Fix linting errors in changed files" --changed-only
```

### Use a Specific Mode

```bash
# Start in planning mode
xibecode run "Analyze this codebase and suggest improvements" --mode plan

# Start in debugging mode
xibecode run "Find the bug causing the API timeout" --mode debugger
```

## How XibeCode Works

When you give XibeCode a task, it follows this autonomous loop:

1. **Read** — Analyzes your project structure, reads relevant files
2. **Plan** — Breaks down the task into steps
3. **Execute** — Creates/edits files, runs commands using 40+ tools
4. **Verify** — Runs tests, checks for errors
5. **Iterate** — Fixes any issues until the task is complete

The entire process is autonomous — XibeCode continues iterating until the task is done or it reaches the maximum iteration limit. It has built-in loop detection to prevent infinite loops.

## Key Features

### Smart Context Discovery

XibeCode automatically discovers related files by following imports, finding tests, and understanding project configuration.

### Automatic Backups

Every file edit creates a timestamped backup. You can revert to any previous state:

```bash
# In chat mode
/revert src/app.ts  # Revert to previous version
```

### Git Integration

XibeCode can create checkpoints before making changes:

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor the database layer (create checkpoint first)"
```

### Test Integration

XibeCode auto-detects your test runner (Vitest, Jest, pytest, Go test, etc.) and runs tests to verify changes.

### Safety Controls

Dangerous commands are blocked, and risky operations are flagged:
- Dry-run mode for safe previews
- Risk assessment before execution
- Command blocking for destructive operations
- Safer alternatives suggested when possible

## Neural Memory

XibeCode learns from your project over time. It remembers patterns, preferences, and lessons learned:

```bash
# The agent automatically stores lessons
# You can also manually teach it
xibecode chat
> Remember that we use Prisma for database access in this project
```
