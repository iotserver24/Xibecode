Real-world examples showing how to use XibeCode for common development tasks. Each example demonstrates autonomous AI-assisted coding.

## Building Features

### Add User Authentication

```bash
xibecode run "Add JWT authentication:
1. Install jsonwebtoken and bcrypt
2. Create auth middleware
3. Add /login and /register endpoints
4. Protect existing routes
5. Add tests"
```

### Create a REST API

```bash
xibecode run "Create a REST API with Express for a todo app:
- GET /todos - List all todos
- POST /todos - Create a todo
- PUT /todos/:id - Update a todo
- DELETE /todos/:id - Delete a todo
- Add input validation
- Include error handling"
```

### Add Database Integration

```bash
xibecode run "Add PostgreSQL database integration:
- Set up Prisma ORM
- Create user and post models
- Add migration scripts
- Create seed data"
```

### Build a React Component

```bash
xibecode run "Create a DataTable component in React:
- Sortable columns
- Pagination
- Search/filter functionality
- Loading and empty states
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind CSS"
```

## Fixing Bugs

### Debug Failing Tests

```bash
xibecode run "The tests in test/user.test.js are failing.
Debug and fix." --verbose --mode debugger
```

Dex the Debugger will: run tests, read source code, identify root cause, apply minimal fix, re-run tests to verify.

### Fix a Production Error

```bash
xibecode run "Production error: 'Cannot read property x of undefined'
in userController.js line 42. Fix it." --verbose --mode debugger
```

### Fix Type Errors

```bash
xibecode run "Fix all TypeScript errors in the src/ directory" --verbose
```

### Fix Linting Errors

```bash
xibecode run "Fix linting errors in changed files" --changed-only
```

### Memory Leak Investigation

```bash
xibecode run "There's a memory leak in the WebSocket handler.
Investigate and fix it." --mode debugger --verbose
```

## Refactoring

### Convert to TypeScript

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor src/ to use TypeScript:
- Convert all .js files to .ts
- Add type annotations
- Create types.ts for shared types
- Update tsconfig.json
- Fix any type errors"
```

### Improve Code Quality

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor the authentication module to follow SOLID principles"
```

### Extract Common Logic

```bash
xibecode run "Extract duplicate validation logic into a shared utils file:
- Find all validation patterns
- Create a validation.ts utility
- Update all files to use the new utility
- Add tests for the utility"
```

### Modernize Legacy Code

```bash
xibecode run "Modernize the callback-based API to use async/await:
- Convert callbacks to Promises
- Use async/await syntax
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Update tests"
```

## Testing

### Generate Tests for a Module

```bash
xibecode run "Write comprehensive tests for userController.js:
- Test all endpoints
- Test error cases and edge cases
- Test validation
- Use Jest
- Achieve >80% coverage" --mode tester
```

### Add Integration Tests

```bash
xibecode run "Add integration tests for the checkout flow:
- Test the complete purchase flow
- Test payment processing
- Test inventory updates
- Test email notifications" --mode tester
```

### Fix Flaky Tests

```bash
xibecode run "The test 'should handle concurrent requests' is flaky.
Investigate and fix it." --mode debugger
```

## Code Review & Security

### Security Audit

```bash
xibecode run "Perform a security audit on the auth module:
- Check for injection vulnerabilities
- Review authentication flow
- Check for data exposure risks
- Suggest improvements" --mode security
```

### Code Review

```bash
xibecode run "Review the recent changes in the payment module:
- Check code quality
- Identify potential issues
- Suggest improvements" --mode review
```

### Dependency Audit

```bash
xibecode run "Check all dependencies for security vulnerabilities
and suggest updates" --mode security
```

## Git Workflows

### Safe Refactoring with Checkpoints

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor the database layer (create checkpoint first)"
```

XibeCode creates a git checkpoint before making changes, so you can revert if anything goes wrong.

### Focus on Changed Files

```bash
xibecode run "Review and fix issues in changed files only" --changed-only
```

### Prepare for Code Review

```bash
xibecode run "Prepare this branch for code review:
- Run tests
- Fix linting errors
- Add missing documentation
- Generate a summary of changes"
```

## Using Different Modes

### Planning Mode

```bash
xibecode run "Analyze the codebase and create a plan for adding
real-time notifications" --mode plan
```

Aria the Architect will analyze and create a detailed plan without making changes.

### Debug Mode

```bash
xibecode run "The API is returning 500 errors intermittently.
Investigate and fix." --mode debugger
```

### Team Leader Mode

```bash
xibecode run "Build a complete user management system with
registration, login, and profile editing" --mode team_leader
```

Arya the Team Leader will coordinate tasks and delegate to specialized agents.

## Using Dry-Run Mode

Preview changes before they're made:

```bash
xibecode run "Refactor the auth module" --dry-run
```

Output will show:

```
[DRY RUN] Would replace lines 15-20 with 8 new lines
[DRY RUN] Would write 150 lines to src/auth/index.ts
[DRY RUN] Would create stash checkpoint: "before auth refactor"
```

## Smart Context in Action

When you ask XibeCode to modify a file, it automatically discovers related files:

```bash
xibecode run "Add error handling to userController.js"
```

XibeCode will:
1. Read `userController.js`
2. Extract and follow imports (User model, auth middleware)
3. Find related test files
4. Check config files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
5. Make edits with full understanding of the codebase

## Multi-Step Workflows

### Full Feature Implementation

```bash
xibecode run "Implement a complete user profile system:
1. Create database schema for profiles
2. Add API endpoints (GET, PUT)
3. Create React components
4. Add form validation
5. Write tests
6. Update documentation"
```

### Migration Workflow

```bash
xibecode run "Migrate from Express to Fastify:
1. Set up Fastify with similar middleware
2. Convert routes one by one
3. Update error handling
4. Update tests
5. Verify all endpoints work"
```

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Be specific about files** — `"Fix src/api/users.js"` is better than `"Fix the users file"`
- **Mention line numbers for large files** — `"Bug around line 500 in data-processor.js"`
- **Use the right mode** — `--mode debugger` for bugs, `--mode tester` for tests
- **Use verbose mode for complex tasks** — `--verbose` shows every tool call
- **Preview with dry-run** — `--dry-run` for risky changes
- **Break down huge tasks** — Do it module by module instead of "Build entire platform"
- **Let AI discover context** — Don't manually list imports, XibeCode finds them
- **Use checkpoints** — Ask for checkpoints before major refactors
