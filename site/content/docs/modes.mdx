XibeCode features 13 specialized agent modes (personas), each optimized for different types of tasks. Each mode has a unique personality, set of allowed tools, and behavioral characteristics.

## Quick Reference

| `seo` | Siri the Optimizer | SEO, web optimization | Yes |
| `product` | Agni the Strategist | Product strategy | Yes |
| `data` | David the Analyst | Data analysis | Yes |

## Switching Modes

```bash
# Via CLI flag
xibecode run "task" --mode plan
xibecode run "task" --mode debugger

# In chat mode
xibecode chat
> /mode plan
> /mode agent
```

## Development Modes

### Agent Mode (Default)

Full autonomous coding with all capabilities enabled.

**Best For:** Building new features, full-stack development, multi-step coding tasks, installing dependencies, running tests and commands.

**Capabilities:** Read and modify files, create new files and directories, run shell commands, execute tests, git operations (read and write), web search and fetch.

```bash
xibecode run "Add a user authentication system" --mode agent
```

### Engineer Mode

**Persona:** Alex the Implementer

Focused implementation mode for building features.

**Best For:** Implementing specific features, writing clean maintainable code, following specifications, writing tests for implementations.

```bash
xibecode run "Implement the checkout flow" --mode engineer
```

## Planning & Analysis Modes

### Plan Mode

**Persona:** Strategic Planner

Interactive planning mode with web research, clarifying questions, and structured `implementations.md` generation.

**Best For:** Creating detailed implementation plans, researching solutions, breaking down complex features into tasks, generating step-by-step plans with code snippets.

**How It Works:**
1. Reads the codebase and researches online
2. Asks clarifying questions (multiple-choice in WebUI, inquirer prompts in CLI)
3. Generates `implementations.md` with checkbox tasks, file paths, and code snippets
4. Shows a plan preview with "View Plan" and "Build" buttons
5. On "Build", switches to Agent mode to execute the plan automatically

**Tools Available:** File reading, web search, fetch URL, git read, context search, and write to `implementations.md` only.

```bash
xibecode run "Plan how to add authentication to this app" --mode plan
```

### Architect Mode

**Persona:** Anna the Designer

System design and high-level architecture planning.

**Best For:** System design documents, component architecture, tech stack selection, design patterns, scalability planning.

```bash
xibecode run "Design the microservices architecture" --mode architect
```

### Researcher Mode

**Persona:** Sanvi the Scholar

Deep research and investigation mode.

**Best For:** Investigating complex topics, reading documentation, analyzing papers and specs, synthesizing information.

```bash
xibecode run "Research best practices for API rate limiting" --mode researcher
```

## Quality & Testing Modes

### Debugger Mode

**Persona:** Dex the Detective

Systematic debugging and root cause analysis.

**Best For:** Finding and fixing bugs, analyzing error messages, root cause investigation, targeted surgical fixes.

**Approach:**
1. Reproduce the issue
2. Isolate the root cause
3. Apply minimal fix
4. Verify the fix works

```bash
xibecode run "The login form is not working. Fix it." --mode debugger
```

### Tester Mode

**Persona:** Tess the QA Engineer

Comprehensive testing and quality assurance.

**Best For:** Writing unit tests, integration testing, test coverage improvement, TDD workflows.

```bash
xibecode run "Write tests for the user service" --mode tester
```

### Review Mode

**Persona:** Nova the Critic

Code review and quality analysis (read-only).

**Best For:** Code quality review, best practices check, performance analysis, maintainability assessment.

**Restrictions:** Cannot modify files.

```bash
xibecode run "Review the authentication module" --mode review
```

### Security Mode

**Persona:** Sentinel the Guardian

Security analysis and vulnerability detection (read-only).

**Best For:** Security audits, vulnerability scanning, injection attack detection, authentication review, data exposure analysis.

**Restrictions:** Cannot modify files, requires confirmation.

```bash
xibecode run "Perform a security audit" --mode security
```

## Specialized Modes

### Team Leader Mode

**Persona:** Arya the Leader

Task coordination and delegation to other modes.

**Best For:** Complex multi-step projects, coordinating multiple concerns, breaking down large tasks.

The Team Leader delegates tasks to specialized agents (Engineer, Architect, Tester, etc.) rather than implementing directly.

```bash
xibecode run "Build a complete e-commerce system" --mode team_leader
```

### Product Mode

**Persona:** Agni the Strategist

Product requirements and user stories.

**Best For:** Requirements gathering, user stories, feature prioritization, PRD creation.

```bash
xibecode run "Create user stories for the dashboard" --mode product
```

### SEO Mode

**Persona:** Siri the Optimizer

SEO and web optimization.

**Best For:** Keyword research, on-page SEO, meta tag optimization, web performance.

```bash
xibecode run "Optimize the landing page for SEO" --mode seo
```

### Data Mode

**Persona:** David the Analyst

Data processing and analysis.

**Best For:** Data analysis, log processing, metrics definition, data visualization prep.

```bash
xibecode run "Analyze the server logs for errors" --mode data
```

## Tool Permissions by Mode

Each mode has access to specific tool categories:

| Category | Description | Modes with Access |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `read_only` | Read files | All modes |
| `write_fs` | Write/edit files | agent, engineer, tester, debugger, architect, team_leader, product, seo, data, researcher |
| `git_read` | Git status, diff | All modes |
| `git_mutation` | Git commit, reset | agent, engineer, tester, debugger |
| `shell_command` | Run commands | agent, engineer, debugger, security, data |
| `tests` | Run tests | agent, engineer, tester, debugger, security, review |
| `network` | Web search, fetch | agent, engineer, seo, researcher |
| `context` | Code search | All modes |

## Mode Transitions

Modes can automatically transition based on the task:
- Plan mode may suggest switching to Agent mode for implementation
- Team Leader delegates to Engineer for coding tasks
- Agent can switch to Debugger when encountering bugs

Configure auto-approval policy in your config:

```json
{
  "autoApprovalPolicy": "always"
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Start with Plan mode** for complex tasks to understand the codebase first
- **Use Debugger mode** for bugs rather than Agent mode for more targeted fixes
- **Use Security mode** before deploying to production
- **Use Review mode** for code quality checks without modifications
- **Use Team Leader** for complex projects that span multiple concerns
