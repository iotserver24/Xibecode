## Requirements

- **Node.js 18.0.0** or higher
- **TypeScript 5.3+** (for development)
- An **AI provider API key** (Anthropic, OpenAI, or compatible)

## Install from npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g xibecode
```

Or use your preferred package manager:

```bash
# pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add -g xibecode

# bun
bun add -g xibecode

# yarn
yarn global add xibecode
```

## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotserver24/Xibecode
cd Xibecode
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Set up API Key

XibeCode needs an AI provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or compatible). You can set it up in three ways:

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```bash
xibecode config
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can configure all settings including API key, model, and preferences.

### Option 2: Direct Configuration

```bash
# Set API key
xibecode config --set-key YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Or for OpenAI
xibecode config --set-key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Option 3: Environment Variable

```bash
# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version
xibecode --version

# View current configuration
xibecode config --show

# Run a simple test
xibecode chat
```

## Directory Structure

XibeCode creates the following directories:

```
~/.xibecode/           # Global configuration
  ├── config.json       # Main configuration file
  ├── mcp-servers.json  # MCP server configurations
  └── backups/          # File backups

.xibecode/             # Project-level (in your working directory)
  ├── memory.json       # Neural memory for this project
  └── skills/           # Custom skills for this project
```

## Supported Platforms

- **macOS** — Full support (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Linux** — Full support (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch)
- **Windows** — Full support (PowerShell and WSL)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied on Global Install

```bash
# Use sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm install -g xibecode

# Better: Fix npm permissions
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

### Node.js Version Too Old

```bash
# Using nvm (Node Version Manager)
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Verify
node --version
```

### API Key Not Working

```bash
# Check if key is set
xibecode config --show

# Test API connection
xibecode chat
# Then type: "Hello" to test
```
